# Shira Suli – Developer Portfolio

This repository serves as a central portfolio containing all the projects I contributed to during my studies, development training, and collaborative work.  
It includes team-based projects, academic assignments, and repositories from organizations where I participated as a collaborator.

The goal of this portfolio is to provide recruiters and hiring managers with direct access to all relevant work demonstrating my technical skills, teamwork, and development capabilities.
